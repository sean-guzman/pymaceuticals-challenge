Rutgers Data Sciences Bootcamp, Module 5 Challenge (27 March 2023)

In this challenge, data is taken from an animal study at Pymaceuticals, Inc. where mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, receive treatment with a range of drug regimens over a 45 day span, where tumor development was observed and measured.

In this analysis, the data is broken down so that we can determine the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Key Takeaways and Conclusions
- Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be the most effective drug regimens in treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) out of the 10 drugs given, with Capomulin averaging 40.68 mm3 and Ramicane averaging 40.22 mm3 in tumor sizes.
- The drug regimens were just about evenly distributed amongst both genders, with Males having the slight majority at 51% over Females at 49%.
- There is a postive correlation of 0.84 between average weight and average tumor size. As we see the weight increase, the tumor size increases in size
